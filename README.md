# JAVA PROGRAMMING
## A Repository of Practice Java Code

This is my learning library. When I have trouble with a concept or need some practice on things I haven't used in a while, I will add them here.

This is also my mad scientist lab. That, meaning the code is likely unstable and may not be runnable at times.

**Categories**

- Intro to Java, Printing to Screen, Variables, Datatypes, Scanner, Loops
- Classes and Objects
	+ Basic review of Classes as Blueprints for Objects
